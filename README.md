PyCity Schools Analysis

Overview:
As the newly appointed Chief Data Scientist for the PyCity school district, my role involves assisting the school board and mayor in making informed decisions regarding future budgets and priorities based on district-wide standardized test results. This project aims to aggregate and analyze data across various dimensions to highlight clear trends in school performance.

Objectives:
Analyze standardized test results across all schools in the district.
Aggregate data to identify trends in school performance.
Assist in strategic decision-making regarding school budgets and priorities.

Data Analysis Tasks:
The analysis covers a broad spectrum of metrics to provide a comprehensive overview of the district's educational performance. The tasks include:

District Summary:
Creation of a high-level snapshot including:

Total number of schools
Total student count
Total budget
Average math and reading scores
Percentage passing in math, reading, and both subjects

School Summary:
Compilation of key metrics for each school, covering:

School name and type:
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average scores and passing percentages

Performance Analysis:
Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing): Identification of the top 5 schools.
Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing): Identification of the bottom 5 schools.
Math and Reading Scores by Grade: Analysis of average scores by grade level.
Scores by School Spending: Breakdown of school performance based on average spending ranges per student.
Scores by School Size: Analysis of school performance based on school size categories.
Scores by School Type: Comparison of performance between Charter and District schools.

Methodology:
Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Performed calculations using Jupyter Notebook to organize, execute, and document the analysis process.
Created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to summarize and present findings.

Key Findings and Insights:
Analysis highlights the impact of school type and size on student performance, with Charter schools and smaller-sized schools showing higher success rates.
A counterintuitive trend was observed where higher spending per student does not necessarily lead to better performance outcomes.
The stability of math and reading scores across grades suggests effective curriculum implementation across the school years.

Conclusions:
The analysis provides critical insights into factors influencing school performance within the PyCity district. These findings emphasize the importance of strategic resource allocation, innovative educational approaches, and the potential benefits of smaller, focused learning environments in enhancing student achievement. Moving forward, it is recommended that the school board and mayor consider these insights in future decision-making processes to foster an educational environment that ensures success for all students.
